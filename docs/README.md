# ArXiv-Miner

> ArXiv Miner is a toolkit for mining research papers on CS ArXiv. 

## What is ArXiv-Miner

`arxiv-miner` is a quick handy library that helps power [Sci-Genie](https://sci-genie.com). Sci-Genie is a search engine for quickly through full text of papers on ArXiv. 

`arxiv-miner` helps extract and parse LaTeX documents from CS ArXiv for indexing in a search engine like Elasticsearch. The library can be applicable for all other domains like Math, Physics, Biology etc. 

## Why was ArXiv-Miner created ?
ArXiv Miner was created to easily scraping, parsing and search of research content on ArXiv. This library was created after stitching together a solution from code from various tools like [arxiv-sanity](https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver), [arxiv-vanity/engrafo](https://github.com/arxiv-vanity/engrafo), [arxivscraper](https://github.com/Mahdisadjadi/arxivscraper) [tex2py](https://github.com/alvinwan/tex2py) and [axcell](https://github.com/paperswithcode/axcell). Parsed structure to content can be further useful in search or any scientific research mining/AI applications as a heuristic baseline.
